# beer-me-analysis
**Beer Analysis Overview**

This project used data from BeerMe! (https://beerme.com/index.php), which contains a list of about 10,000 beers tried by Richard Stueven over more than 25 years. This site is one of the most comprehensive beer lists online and provided a great starting point for doing some beer analysis. 

A website was built (https://agarett.github.io/beer-me-analysis) to host the data and visualizations. The data analysis was done with Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebook.
